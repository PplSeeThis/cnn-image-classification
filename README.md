# CNN for Image Classification

A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify images from the Intel Image Classification dataset. This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for a multi-class image classification task.



## üìú Project Overview

[cite_start]The main goal of this project is to develop a CNN capable of classifying landscape images into one of several categories (e.g., buildings, forest, sea)[cite: 13]. The model is trained on the [Kaggle Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset.

Key steps included:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Images were resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized.
* [cite_start]**Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random horizontal flips and rotations were applied to the training set to improve model generalization[cite: 29, 55, 57].
* [cite_start]**Model Architecture:** A custom CNN was built with three convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation and a MaxPooling layer[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Training & Evaluation:** The model was trained for 10 epochs, achieving a final validation accuracy of over 85%[cite: 31, 215].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

* [cite_start]**Language:** Python 3.10 [cite: 23]
* **Core Libraries:**
    * [cite_start]PyTorch [cite: 24]
    * [cite_start]Torchvision [cite: 24]
    * [cite_start]Matplotlib [cite: 24]
    * NumPy
* [cite_start]**Environment:** Kaggle Notebooks [cite: 25]

## üìà Results

The model demonstrated strong performance in classifying the images.
* [cite_start]**Peak Validation Accuracy:** **86.93%** (achieved at epoch 9) [cite: 261]
* [cite_start]**Final Test Accuracy:** **85.07%** [cite: 257]

Below are the graphs showing the training loss and validation accuracy per epoch.
