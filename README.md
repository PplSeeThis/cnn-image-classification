# CNN for Image Classification

A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify images from the Intel Image Classification dataset. This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for a multi-class image classification task.



## üìú Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a CNN capable of classifying landscape images into one of several categories (e.g., buildings, forest, sea). The model is trained on the [Kaggle Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset.

Key steps included:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Images were resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random horizontal flips and rotations were applied to the training set to improve model generalization.
* **Model Architecture:** A custom CNN was built with three convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation and a MaxPooling layer.
* **Training & Evaluation:** The model was trained for 10 epochs, achieving a final validation accuracy of over 85%.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

* **Language:** Python 3.10 
* **Core Libraries:**
    * PyTorch 
    * Torchvision 
    * Matplotlib 
    * NumPy
* **Environment:** Kaggle Notebooks 

## üìà Results

The model demonstrated strong performance in classifying the images.
* **Peak Validation Accuracy:** **86.93%** (achieved at epoch 9) 
* **Final Test Accuracy:** **85.07%** 

Below are the graphs showing the training loss and validation accuracy per epoch.
